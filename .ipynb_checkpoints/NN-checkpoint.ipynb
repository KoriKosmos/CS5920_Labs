    "\n",
    "The function `nearest_neighbour_conformal_predictor(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)` is defined to implement the Nearest Neighbour Conformal Predictor. Conformal prediction is a technique for providing a measure of certainty for machine learning predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Conformity Measures:** The function calculates the conformity measures for all test instances. This is done by applying the `conformity_measure` function to each test sample and its corresponding label. The resulting conformity measures are stored in the `alphas` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate P-values:** The function calculates the p-values for all possible labels for all test instances. The p-value for a test instance is the proportion of conformity measures from the training set that are lower than or equal to the conformity measure of the test instance. The p-values are stored in the `p_values` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Average False P-value:** The function calculates the average false p-value, which is the mean of the p-values for test instances that were incorrectly classified. This is done by selecting the p-values corresponding to test instances where the predicted label is less than the true label, and calculating the mean of these selected p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns the average false p-value, which provides a measure of the error rate of the conformal predictor. Lower average false p-values indicate better performance."
